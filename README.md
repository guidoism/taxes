# Taxes

This is my attempt at the various IRS forms for my taxes into
javascript so I can use them in Google Sheets.

# Warning I am not a tax professional and I can't guarantee that they
are correct. In fact, not only that, but I can guarantee that they are
wrong because I've simplified them in places where they don't make
sense for my specific situation.

Despite that I've tried my best to make them accurate.

If you sue me, then, well, you suck.
