# Taxes

This is my attempt at the various IRS forms for my taxes into
javascript so I can use them in Google Sheets.

# Warning

I am not a tax professional and I can't guarantee that this is perfectly
correct. In fact, not only that, but I can guarantee that it's
wrong since I've simplified it in places where it doesn't make
sense for my specific situation.

Despite that I've tried my best to make it accurate.

If you sue me, then, well, you suck.

# Included taxes

* 2017 Federal Income Tax (Form 1040 for married couples and singles)
